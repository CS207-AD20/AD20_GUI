Beyond the Basics: Extensions and Software Development
======================================================

We have presented one way of thinking about automatic differentiation and the graph structure of functions which underly the computations in both forward and reverse mode.  This section includes another way of thinking about automatic differentiation through dual numbers and considerations about how to implement automatic differentiation in software.
