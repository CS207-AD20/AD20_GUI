# Summary
growing interest in machine learning
automatic differentiation as underlying backprop, and many other computational techniques so important to learn basis
automatic differentiation definition
has two modes based on underlying graph structure

## Auto-eD Visualization Software
Goal of being able to visualize underlying graphs and calculations
Basic simple automatic differentiation package
Graph features to see forward and reverse mode as well as visualize steps of reverse dynamically
Available for developers to download and use as a package
Available to be downloaded locally and launched as a web app
Available on heroku

## Accompanying Automatic Differentiation Unit
Series of modules to teach the basics of automatic differentiation accompanied by learning the tool
Available on read the docs
Outline of each module
Similar structure has been used to teach these concepts in Harvard IACS CS 207, last year introduced GUI
