# AD20_GUI
This repository contains the final project extension of Group 20 (Lindsey Brown, Xinyue Wang, Kevin Yoon) for CS 207.  The GUI uses the automatic differentiation package AD20 
to create a pedagogical tool for teaching about the graph structure of computations.

Note that the GUI is stored separately from the rest of the package to avoid polluting the test suite of the main package.

In order to use the GUI, first install AD20 using "pip install AD20."  Download and save the files AD20_GUI.py and ADgraph_GUI.py to the
same location (as each other).  Run the AD20_GUI.py file.
