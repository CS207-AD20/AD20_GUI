# Auto-eD
Auto-eD is a web application to help students learn the basics behind automatic differentiation by helping them to visualize the computational graph structure which underlies these computations in forward and reverse mode.

An automatic differentiation unit that teaches the basics of automatic differentiation with this tool to help with visualization can be found on [Read the Docs](https://auto-ed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This repository contains the final project extension of Group 20 (Lindsey Brown, Xinyue Wang, Kevin Yoon) for CS 207.  The GUI uses the automatic differentiation package AD20 
to create a pedagogical tool for teaching about the graph structure of computations.

Note that the GUI is stored separately from the rest of the package to avoid polluting the test suite of the main package.

In order to use the GUI, first install AD20 using "pip install AD20."  Download and save the files AD20_GUI.py and ADgraph_GUI.py to the
same location (as each other).  Run the AD20_GUI.py file.
